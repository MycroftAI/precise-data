# Precise Data

Binary data used for Mycroft Precise

This repository holds the following branches:

 - `dist`: Precise executables for various linux architectures used to make inferences on raw audio data
 - `models`: A set of pretrained models for use with Precise. Each model consists of a `.pb` file and a `.pb.params` file. Both are necessary to run
